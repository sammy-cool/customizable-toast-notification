> ðŸ”” Elegant, zero-dependency toast notifications for any frontend â€” customizable themes, icons, animations & positions.

A simple and highly customizable toast notification library for modern JavaScript applications.  
It allows you to display responsive toast messages with full control over timing, styling, iconography, animation, and placement â€” all without relying on any third-party libraries.

These are typically generated via services like:

shields.io

npm-stat.com

bundlephobia.com

NEXT = If your toast also supports dark mode, accessibility (ARIA), or custom animation hooks, I can help you enhance this further.
